# NFLStatRetrieval
This no longer works since I am banned from NFL.com for not using a better delay between requests. ;(

This program retrieves the stats for any NFL player for any season on record, but currently only supports a limited number of QBs listed in the QBlist.csv file.

Current Goals:
  - Add a feature that allows the user to view stats in a visually aesthetic and easy to read graph or chart through a "Charts" button on the main window
  - Add Rushing, Receiving, Fumble, Defensive, and Punting stats
  - Add Running backs to supported players
  - Add Receivers to supported players
  - Add a function to retrieve Fantasy Football Stats for all supported players
