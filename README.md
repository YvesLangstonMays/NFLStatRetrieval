# NFLStatRetrieval

This program retrieves the stats for any NFL player for any season on record, but currently only supports a limited number of QBs listed in the QBlist.csv file.

  - Add a feature that allows the user to view stats in a visually aesthetic and easy to read graph or chart
  - Add Rushing, Receiving, Fumble, Defensive, and Punting stats
  - Add Running backs to supported players
  - Add Receivers to supported players
